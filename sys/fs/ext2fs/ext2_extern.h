 * block freeing.
 *
 * Validation is active in ALL builds (debug and production).  This is
 * a cheap check (comparisons) on the error path, and omitting it in
 * production would leave corrupted runs silently corrupting i_blocks.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Called WITHOUT EXT2_LOCK held (returns EDEADLK if held)
 *   - phys_start != 0 (returns EINVAL)
 *   - length > 0 (returns EINVAL)
 *   - length <= EXT4_MAX_LEN (returns EINVAL)
 *   - phys_start within filesystem block range
 *     [e2fs_first_dblock, e2fs_bcount) (returns EINVAL)
 *   - phys_start + length - 1 does not overflow uint64_t
 *     and does not exceed e2fs_bcount - 1 (returns EFBIG or EINVAL)
 *   - i_blocks does not underflow (returns EIO)
 *
 * NOTE: range validation proves only that the run lies inside the
 * filesystem's legal block range.  It does NOT prove ownership —
 * that the blocks were allocated by this operation, are still
 * allocated, or match the recorded allocation.  The scalar
 * (phys_start, length) interface cannot provide these guarantees.
 *
 * The context-based ext2_rollback_allocation() provides stronger
 * validation by tracking:
 *   - whether blocks were allocated by this context (not a stale
 *     or unrelated range);
 *   - whether accounting was applied (accounting_applied flag);
 *   - the publication state (state >= PUBLISHED forbids rollback).

 *   is retained for caller sites that have not yet been converted.
 *
 * Delegates to:

 *   2. ext2_abort_allocated_runs() — frees the physical blocks via
 *      ext2_blkfree() (manages its own locking).
 *
 * Contract (all enforced by ext2_rollback_inode_accounting):
 *   - Called WITHOUT EXT2_LOCK held — callers that hold the lock
 *     (e.g. ext2_balloc.c multi-block EFBIG path) must release it

 *   - phys_start != 0

 *   - phys_start within filesystem block range
 *   - phys_start + length - 1 does not overflow and does not exceed
 *     e2fs_bcount
 *   - i_blocks does not underflow
 *
 * Publication state:
 *   The blocks MUST be unpublished — i.e., no on-disk inode metadata
 *   (direct/indirect block pointers, extent records) references them.
 *   If a pointer has been committed to storage via bwrite(), the
 *   operation is a consistency repair, not an allocation rollback.
 *
 * Buffer ownership:
 *   The caller is responsible for releasing any held buffers (e.g.
 *   bp from bread() or getblk()) before or after calling this
 *   helper.  The helper operates only on the inode and the
 *   physical extent; it does not touch caller-owned buffers.
